      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> Rubsi </p>
      <p>Rubsi is a jewelry brand born in San Diego, CA. with the goal of creating sustainable, long lasting pieces. These pieces strive to be timeless in an effort to survive despite the fast fashion cycles that have become all too familiar.</p>
      <h2>Target audience</h2>
      <p>The target audience behind Rubsi's website is those that are interested in investing in well made pieces that can last a lifetime. In addition to this, those that are cognizant of the effect their choices, primarily shopping choices have on the environment. Due to the fact that Rubsi is a small boutique shop with one location, the site would largely be of use to those that are residents of the San Diego Metropolitan area. </p>
      <!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
      <p> The primary goal of Rubsi is to address the issue that the fashion industry has with creating very trendy pieces that are cheaply made using unethical practices. To address the issue of excess as well as waste, Rubs creates well made pieces that wonâ€™t tarnish in order to be appreciated and used for a lifetime. Rather than a focus on quantity, the notion is of quality is one that is paid close attention to. </p>
